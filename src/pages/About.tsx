        <p className="text-gray-700 w-[600px]">
          I am a certified full-stack software developer with a solid foundation
          in building responsive and user-friendly web applications. I
          specialize in front-end development using TypeScript, React, and
          Tailwind CSS, and also have hands-on experience with backend
          technologies like Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, and RESTful APIs. With
          a BSc in Mathematics and practical experience from real-world
          projects, I bring analytical thinking and problem-solving skills into
          every line of code. I enjoy working across the stack to build
          scalable, efficient, and modern applications. I'm passionate about
          continuous learning and staying up to date with the latest
          technologies. Letâ€™s build something impactful together!
